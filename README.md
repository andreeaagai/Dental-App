# 🦷 eDentify - Dental Clinic Website

A modern and responsive React website built for a dental clinic. The application includes online appointment functionality, a full presentation of services, pricing, contact information, and a gallery of before-and-after transformations. This project was built from scratch and fully redesigned based on the outdated version of the previous site, with a focus on improved structure, responsiveness, and usability.

## 📌 About the Project

This is a solo project created from scratch. The goal was to modernize an existing dental clinic website that lacked mobile support and had a poor structure. All components were built and styled manually, with a clean code structure and modular logic using React best practices.
